# Computational Biology Position Specific Scoring Matrix
Implementing Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) Algorithm using Python for computational biological tasks. 



PSSM 

1. The multiple aligned DNA sequences is produced in 2 ways:
   
a. Reading the prepared multiple aligned DNA sequences from file called PSSMData.txt where first line is for the values of t sequences, and n nucleotides. 

b.  Generate t sequences where one sequence of length n is formed of random order of nucleotides. 

2. Print the multiple aligned DNA sequences.
   
3. Apply PSSM on the multiple aligned DNA sequences.
   
4. Print the PSSM matrix
   
5. Let user enter a new sequence of length n, then print the probability of new entered sequence joining the rest of the multiple aligned DNA sequences.
